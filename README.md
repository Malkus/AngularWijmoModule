Purpose
=======
Create a custom Angular Wrapper for Wijmo


Summary
=======
The most recent module provided by Wijmo is incompatible with IE8.

Because of this and in order to keep autonomy between Wijmo and Angular 
I wanted to create an angular module with the goal of being more readable and easy to use.

I intend to add more functionality and make it more generic, but wanted to make it available to people.
